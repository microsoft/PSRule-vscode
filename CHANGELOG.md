# Change log

All notable changes to this extension will be documented in this file.
This extension is available in two release channels for Visual Studio Code from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
We recommend only installing one channel for the best experience.
Installing both channels may cause unexpected behavior.

- [Preview][ext-preview] - More frequent releases but more likely to contain bugs.
  - _Preview_ is where updates are available before they released to _Stable_.
  - This channel includes changes listed in the _Unreleased_ heading.
  - Versioning for _Preview_ follows an `year.month.revision` that increments for each release.
- [Stable][ext-stable] - Less frequent releases, with more user testing, experimental features are disabled.
  - Uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to declare changes.
  - Aligned to versioning of PSRule.
